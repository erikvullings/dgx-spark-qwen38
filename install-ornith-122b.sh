# Flash FP4-Local lane's image, 18 GB (10 to download), which the two lanes share: when the disk
# does not have the room, this refuses before downloading anything.
#
# WHY THIS IMAGE. The checkpoint mixes NVFP4 experts read as W4A16 and FP8 projections, which
# ModelOpt calls MIXED_PRECISION: the community b12x vLLM build NVIDIA's Flash FP4-Local card names
# for a DGX Spark reads it with the b12x kernels and loader it serves FP4-Local with, and served this
# model right on every test (docs/ornith-lane.md says what was measured). The two lanes pull it once.
