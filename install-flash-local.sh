# NVIDIA's quantization-aware distillation, its n-gram embedding table in NVFP4 too), served by
# the community b12x vLLM image its model card names for a DGX Spark, on the text lanes' port

#   ./install-flash-local.sh --uninstall     remove the unit (the checkpoint and the image kept, said)
#   ./install-flash-local.sh --units-only    the unit alone: no image, no checkpoint (install.sh, on demand)
#   ./install-flash-local.sh --prepare       its image, pulled with no sudo: the cockpit's first Load
#                                            runs it (./prepare-lane.sh flash-local)
#   ./install-flash-local.sh --room          the room its table's copies need, said before a download
#   ./install-flash-local.sh --stage FILE    the unit for the checkpoint in the cache, written to FILE
#                                            with no sudo, its chat template and its table made ready
#                                            first: switch-model.sh flash-local installs FILE
#
# THE N-GRAM TABLE is read at every token, from the checkpoint's files: a cache on another disk than
# the home directory's (an external SSD) gets copies of the table's files beside the home directory,
# in ~/flash-local-ple, which the unit mounts over the cache's own (ple-table.py says why and how);
# FLASH_LOCAL_PLE_DIR=<folder> puts them elsewhere (outside the cache), FLASH_LOCAL_PLE_DIR=none reads
# the table where the cache is, and the choice holds for every run after, a Load from the cockpit
# included (FLASH_LOCAL_PLE_DIR= brings the default back). The copies the lane made are listed in
# their folder, and they alone are ever removed there.
#
# install.sh puts this lane's unit in on every plain install, like the other lanes, and its first
# Load from the cockpit pulls its image and fetches its checkpoint; ./install.sh --no-flash-local
# leaves it out for good (a marker file remembers it). It takes a checkpoint of 103 GB and an image
# of 18 GB (10 to download): when the disk does not have the room, this refuses before downloading
# anything.
#
# WHY A LANE OF ITS OWN. The flash lane serves Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on SGLang, from checkpoints whose
# n-gram table is FP8 (51 GB, written again beside the cache at every boot). NVIDIA's FP4-Local
# build packs the table in NVFP4 (29 GB) inside the checkpoint's own files, read in place over
# io_uring at every token, in a format only this image reads (vLLM with b12x): 33 GB less on disk,
# 10 GiB less of weights in memory, and a KV cache of 921,090 tokens at the card's memory share
# (measured on the reference box, 2026-10-19; docs/flash-local-lane.md).
#
# ONE ENGINE AT A TIME. The unit says so with Conflicts=: starting it stops whichever lane
# serves, and starting another lane stops it.
