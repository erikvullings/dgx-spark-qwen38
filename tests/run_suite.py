"""Every test file of the repo, run once, on its own, as a human runs it, several at a time.

The offline step ran each file on its own, then tests/test_suite_isolation.py ran each unittest
module again in a process of its own to see whether it left an environment variable changed for
the files after it, and that file itself ran twice, in the offline step and in the single-process
pass: the suite ran about four times in a CI run (counted on 2026-10-24). This runs each file once
and takes every fact from that one run:

- it passes, and a unittest file runs as many tests as it declares when invoked directly (a file
  without a __main__ block exits 0 having run nothing);
- it leaves no environment variable changed on its way out (sitecustomize.py below compares the
  process's environment at its start and at its exit), the fact the files after it in one process
  would inherit;
- it contacts no serving port (the same hook records a connect() to one, with the test line).

Files that take a port number out of a socket they close (getsockname()[1]) run one at a time once
the others are over: a file running beside them could be handed the same port meanwhile. The
witness HOME, the listeners and what is left running are the CI step's, around this script.

Usage: run_suite.py [--jobs N] [--report FILE] [--repo DIR --first F1,F2]   (exit 1 on any failure;
--repo and --first point it at another tree, for its own tests)
