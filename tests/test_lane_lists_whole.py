"""Every list of the lanes names them all.

Eight engine lanes share the box, one at a time, and each script that stops, starts, lists or
removes them carries its own list of them: some thirty lists in a dozen files, shell, Python and the
page's JavaScript. A lane added and forgotten in one of them was a box left with no engine: the image
and video installers' lists did not name the eighth lane (found in review, 2026-10-20). The lanes are
the unit templates that name the others in Conflicts=, and every list must name, exactly, all of
them, all but its own lane, the text lanes, the vLLM lanes, or one of five narrower families, each
read from what it is about: the lanes that keep a lane-before link, the units conformity.py reads,
the lanes whose unit mounts the Hugging Face cache, the lanes that are not SGLang's text lanes, and
the vLLM lanes that run b12x. A list names a lane by its unit, with or without ".service", or by the constant that holds it
(FLASH_LOCAL_UNIT, lc.KOLIBRI_UNIT): read by units alone, the lists made of names were never checked
(found in review, 2026-10-20). A ninth lane added to the templates and missed in one list fails here,
with the file and the line, and so does a list that lost a lane, unless what it kept is itself a
family: a list of the other lanes in the image installer that lost the video lane is the text
lanes, which the same file lists for good (found in review, 2026-10-20). Telling those apart takes
binding each list to its family, one by one, which this does by name for the vLLM and b12x lists."""
