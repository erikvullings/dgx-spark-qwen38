"""The text switch says which lane it stops, read from every lane's unit.

./switch-model.sh <text target> ends on the command that makes the switch effective: "stop <the lane
that serves> && start <the target>". It found the lane that serves among the units it names one by
one, and the Flash FP4-Local lane was not among them: with that lane serving, a switch to the flash
lane printed "restart qwen38-flash.service", naming the wrong lane and hiding that the one serving
would stop (found in review, 2026-10-20). Every side lane's unit name the script declares must be
among those it checks. Read from the script as written."""
