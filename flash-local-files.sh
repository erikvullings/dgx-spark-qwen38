# flash-local-files.sh <index> <copy>...: what the Flash FP4-Local lane's engine reads has to be there
# before it runs, and its unit asks this before the engine, as its main process (the head of its
# ExecStart, after the memory guard every lane runs).
#
# The checkpoint at its pinned revision, and the copies of its n-gram table the unit mounts. A start
# without them made runc create what was missing, owned by root: the checkpoint's folders inside the
# Hugging Face cache, which install.sh then read as a lane begun, and a folder in place of a missing
# copy (found in review, proved on the reference box, 2026-10-20). The checkpoint is its index and
# every file the index names: a fetch cut short leaves the small index before the large files, and
# the engine then died at every start, which systemd started again every 15 s (found in review,
# 2026-10-20). A copy has its original's size in the cache: an empty one, or one cut short, is no
# copy, and a folder left in a copy's place is none either. A cache on a disk mounted late at boot
# gets 90 s to come, counted in tries rather than read off the clock, which can jump at boot.
# Without them this says what is missing and what brings it back, the disk first (a Load with it
# away fetches the checkpoint onto the system's disk), on a line the cockpit reads ("preflight:
# <unit> lacks its files"), and exits 78, which the unit's RestartPreventExitStatus holds for its
# main process: from an ExecStartPre= the same 78 was started again every 15 s (found in review,
# 2026-10-20).
#
# A script of its own, as flash-ats-check.sh is the flash lane's: engine-inputs.py leaves it out of
# what the engine reads (NOT_INPUTS), so a new wording of it never asks a serving lane to restart.
# FLASH_LOCAL_FILES_TRIES sets the tries of 3 s (30 by default, the tests' to shorten).
