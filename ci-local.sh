# A full run takes the workflow's jobs side by side, as on GitHub, each in a checkout of its
# own: a detached worktree of HEAD, so the tree has to be clean (what runs is HEAD^{tree}).
# Within a job the steps run in order. A job that needs others (checks) runs once they
# have ended, and only when every one of them passed, as on GitHub. A fragment, and any
# run with CI_LOCAL_SERIAL=1, runs every step it takes in this checkout as it is, one after
# the other.
# Exit status: 1 when a step failed, 2 when a full run finds changes nobody committed, 3
# when nothing ran (a filter that matched no step, or only skipped ones), 0 otherwise.
