# Install the Nemotron lane: NVIDIA's Nemotron 3.5 Bolt, a mixture of experts of 74B parameters
# (9B active per token) compressed to 24 GB (its experts in 2 bits), with reasoning, tool calling
# and image and video input, served by vLLM on the text lanes' port behind the proxy and its key.
# Idempotent, and safe to run alone.
#
#   ./install-nemotron.sh                 first install, or update in place
#   ./install-nemotron.sh --no-smoke      skip the proof at the end
#   ./install-nemotron.sh --uninstall     remove the unit (weights kept, and the image while the
#                                         Nemotron Super lane uses it)
#   ./install-nemotron.sh --units-only    the unit alone: no image, no weights (install.sh, on demand)
#   ./install-nemotron.sh --prepare       its image, built with no sudo: the cockpit's first Load
#                                         runs it (./prepare-lane.sh nemotron)
#
# install.sh puts this lane's unit in on every plain install, like the other lanes, and its first
# Load from the cockpit builds it; ./install.sh --no-nemotron leaves it out for good (a marker file
# remembers it). It takes 26 GB of weights (the model and its drafter) and a 25 GB image, 35 at its
# pull's peak; when the disk does not have the room, this refuses before downloading anything.
#
# WHY THIS BUILD. NVIDIA's model card serves Bolt with one vLLM nightly, 77154ca6, plus the b12x
# kernel library (its 2-bit IQ2_XXS experts, NVFP4 Mamba layers and Q8_0 layers run on b12x on the
# GB10, SM121). That image is published for arm64; this builds on it, pinned by the digest of its
# arm64 manifest, plus b12x's wheel checked against the sha256 PyPI publishes, installed with
# --no-deps (the image already carries every dependency b12x names, checked with pip check). The
# card's other step, `vllm download-kernels`, installs FlashInfer's prebuilt kernels: this image
# already holds exactly those (flashinfer-cubin and flashinfer-jit-cache 0.7.0.post1, sm121a among
# them), so it is not run, and the lane starts with no internet.
#
# ONE ENGINE AT A TIME. The unit says so with Conflicts=: starting it stops whichever lane
# serves, and starting another lane stops it.
